# Embedded Snake Game
## System Explanation
The Embedded Snake Game is built on the [SeeedStudio BeagleBoneÂ® Green](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleBone_Green/) development board, providing users with an interactive snake game experience. The game is controlled using a joystick, and the visuals are displayed on four 8x8 matrices. A 3-button interface governs various game functionalities, with the green button initiating gameplay, the red button ending a round, and the blue button allowing users to select levels (ranging from 1 to 6), each increasing the snake's speed.

A tri-colour LED plays a crucial role in signalling game events, turning green when the snake consumes a fruit and red when the game round ends due to the snake eating itself. A speaker emits sounds when the snake consumes fruit or when the game round ends. The comprehensive setup ensures an engaging gaming experience, combining hardware elements seamlessly.
